**I work at the intersection of nonlinear dynamics and machine learning — and I’m actively looking for collaborations.**  
If you’re exploring data-driven modeling of complex systems, dynamical networks, or ML for time-delay/oscillatory phenomena, let’s talk.

## About
I’m an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics, School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Bennett University (Greater Noida, India). My background spans postdoctoral work in computational neuroscience and dynamical systems, and faculty roles across Indian universities.

- **Current:** Associate Professor, Bennett University (2022–present)  
- **Previous:** Assistant Professor, Bennett University (2020–2022); Assistant Professor, Shivaji College, University of Delhi (2017–2020); Visiting Faculty, Ashoka University (2016–2017); Assistant Professor, Central University of Rajasthan (2014–2016)  
- **Postdoctoral:** LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans (with Carmen Canavier); Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Leipzig (with Jürgen Jost)  
- **Ph.D.:** Jawaharlal Nehru University (Advisor: Ramakrishna Ramaswamy)

## Research Interests
- Exact stochastic simulation of chemical kinetics  
- Coupled/complex networks and synchronization  
- Neural synchrony and hybrid neural networks  
- Time-delay coupled dynamical systems  
- Generalized & strange nonchaotic synchronization  
- Multistability, adaptation, and plasticity in nonlinear systems

## Teaching & Course Design
Topics I teach and design around include:
- Nonlinear dynamics and complex systems  
- Physics for broader audiences (e.g., **Physics for Poets**)  
- Principles of science and computation (**The Art of Computing**, **Physics of Positive Psychology**)

## Mentoring & Community
I regularly mentor student projects on synchronization, stochastic modeling, and adaptation/plasticity in biological and engineered systems. I also enjoy informal weekend research meetups to trade ideas across disciplines.

## Collaborate
I’m keen to co-advise and co-publish on:
- Data-driven discovery of dynamical laws (reservoir/Koopman/NN-based approaches)  
- Time-delay networks, phase oscillator models, and chemical/neuronal synchrony  
- Stochastic simulation for biochemical reaction networks
